# Enhancing_Metal_Smelting_Plant_Efficiency_Predictive-Analytics
This project explores how predictive analytics can optimize efficiency in a metal smelting plant. By analyzing historical production data, we identify patterns and build predictive models to forecast equipment failures, optimize resource allocation, and reduce downtime. Using advanced machine learning techniques, this approach enhances operational decision-making, ultimately lowering costs and improving productivity within the plant.
